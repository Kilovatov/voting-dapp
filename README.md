# Simple Voting DApp

## Steps to start DApp locally
* Run `npm ci`
* Run `npm run compile-contract`. It will create two files (`.bin` and `.abi`)
* Start ganache locally (you may do it with `npm run create-local-blockchain`);
* Now you are ready to deploy contract to your blockchain: `npm run deploy-contract`;
* Open `index.html` and check the coting system.
